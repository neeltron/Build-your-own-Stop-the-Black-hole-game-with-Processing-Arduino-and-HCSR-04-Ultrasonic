Aim of the Game: Once the game is started, the player will have to place his hand at some distance from the Ultrasonic sensor to stop the Blackhole from growing. Ironically, it is impossible to stop the blackhole completely, so the score will be based on the duration for which the Player holds the black hole before it covers up his entire screen. Basically, this game is based on both Player's action and probability since the HC-SR04 sensor is an Ultrasonic sensor, so the waves can easily penetrate the Player's hand.
